As a resident of this city, I decided to use Munich in my project. The city is divided into 55 neightborhoods in total in an area of 310 km\u00b2.[1]\n\nAs you can see from these data, Munich is a city with a high population density. With my data analysis I would like to support someone who wants to open an organic supermarket in Munich. With the analysis of the venues in Munich I would like to find districts in which cultural facilities or restaurants are less available but sports facilities, playgrounds and food shopping facilities are more represented. However, the number of organic supermarkets should be low in these areas to have as little competitors as possible. Since a supermarket needs a relatively large area to operate, I use the rent index to find areas where rents are not as high. Also, it is expected that in areas with low rents, people are more likely to live and therefore need to buy food. \n"
